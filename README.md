In `a.html` mission is to:
Run these pages with your favorite web server.
				
Tip: call up the page using localhost as the domain (this will allow the Gigya API key to work properly):
http://localhost/.../a.html

1) Add the Gigya login component showLoginUI within a container
2) After authentication, redirect to b.html
3) Bonus points: from the authentication response, if email is not
present in the User object, prompt the user to enter an email, then
redirect to b.html (no need to persist email, just ask for it)
(hint: you will need to use addEventHandlers for the onLogin event)
4) Bonus-bonus points: show some kind of counter or flag indicating how
many times the user has logged in (e.g., use a cookie or database).
(You can use whatever server-side or client-side implementation you want)

In `b.html` mission is to:
1) At first to enhance the user experience by providing more detail from input parameters
2) Add the Gigya connect component, showAddConnectionsUI, in a containing div
3) From the events generated by the connection component, indicate the connected
social network providers on the page (hint: you will need to use addEventHandlers)
4) Modify the logout (below) to use the Gigya logout API call
5) Bonus points: add a sharing experience, either via publishUserAction or showShareUI

(Note: while implementation is important, layout and user experience also matters.)
